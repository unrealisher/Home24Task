1) **Change State format**\
I don't really like it, because all data is inside one field `categories[0]`.\
As it's a marketplace, I suppose there will be a lot of information about cards, so I'm thinking about using normalization.
2) **Improve infrastructure**\
I mean improving eslint, stylelint, test and etc. rules.
3) **Improve accessibility**\
I didn't have time for that
4) **Add additional loading for cards**\
Add loading after scrolling
5) **Add functionality**\
Such as "add to cart" and "search"
6) **Make a good test coverage**\
At least 75-80%
7) **Replace React.Context with Redux**\
And use Redux Thunk or similar to get data
